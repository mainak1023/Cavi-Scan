## 📌 Overview

**Cavi-Scan** is an AI-powered system for detecting **dental cavities (caries)** from intraoral and radiographic images using deep learning models. It combines a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **VGG-16 (transfer learning)** to classify dental images as *Cavity Detected* or *No Cavity Detected*. The system is deployed through a React.js-based web interface, making it useful for clinical, educational, and tele-dentistry applications.
